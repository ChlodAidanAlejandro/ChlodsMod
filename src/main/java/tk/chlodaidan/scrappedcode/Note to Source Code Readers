Hey!

So... I have scrapped code which is some features that I have given up on coding due to either
overtime on one code or too much errors or crashes due to Eclipse or Forge. If you would like, you
can fix these codes, take off all errors and send the source code back to me so that I would
implement it AND even include your name in the mcmod.info file. Here are the codes included:

Dimension Codes (These go into com.chlod.ChlodsMod.dimension)
- DimensionRegistry
- WorldProviderExtra
- TeleporterExtra

Block Codes (This goes into com.chlod.ChlodsMod.objects.blocks
- ExtraPortal

Oh! And also remove the comments from the portal registry from the Blocks main registry.

For the dimension codes, I use the "ExtraDim" word and for the biomes I use the "ExtraBiome" word
if you would like to make references. You also need to take off the /**/ comment lines at each end
of the code. Thanks!!!
